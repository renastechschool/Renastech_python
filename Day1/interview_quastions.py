# Q. What is Python and why it is so popular?
# Ans: Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
# Pythonâ€™s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
# It is popular because it has a simplified syntax which gives more emphasis on natural language.

#Q.Python an interpreted language. Explain.
#Ans: An interpreted language is any programming language which
# is not in machine-level code before runtime. Therefore, Python is an interpreted language.

#Q. Why python execution is slow and how we can improve it?

# Ans: The Reason Behind Python code execute slow is because it is an interpreted language.
# Its code is interpreted at the runtime instead of being compiled to a native language.
# To improve the speed of Python code, we can use CPython, Numba instead of core python or we can also do some changes in our code.
# 1. Reducing Memory Footprints.
# 2. Using Built-in Functions and Libraries.
# 3. Move calculation Outside the loop.
# 4. Keeping Code Base Small.
# 5. Avoid Unwanted Loops

#Q. What Are The Features Of Python?
# Ans: 1. Easy to Code
# 2. Free and Open Souce Language
# 3. High-Level Language
# 4. Easy to Debug
# 5. OOPS support
# 6. Large Collection of standard libraries and third-party modules
# 7. Extensible Feature(we can write python code in c and c++ also)
# 8. User-Friendly Data Structure


# Q. What Are The Applications of Python?

# Ans: 1. Web Development
# 2. Desktop GUI Development
# 3. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning
# 4. Software Development
# 5. Business Application Development
# 6. Console Based Application
# 7. Software Testing
# 8. Web Automation
# 9. Audio or Video-Based Application
